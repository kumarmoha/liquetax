# Admin Dashboard Fixes

This document outlines the issues found and fixes implemented for the Liquetax Admin Dashboard.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Blog HTML Drop Zone Functionality

**Problem:** The HTML drop zone for blog imports was not working properly. The drop event handler was missing the code to process the dropped files.

**Solution:** 
- Added proper event handling for the drop event

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the social-connect.js file to handle different button formats
- Added support for both standard buttons and simple method buttons
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added proper state management for connected accounts
- Fixed the simple social page functionality

## Implementation Instructions
